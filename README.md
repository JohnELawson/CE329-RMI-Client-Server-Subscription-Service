# CE329-RMI-Client-Server-Subscription-Service

Final coursework code uploaded for Module CE329.

A Java client - server subscription service based on Java RMI.

With the use of RMI and security policies, two programs communicate with each other.

They allow the 'server' to create, update and delete items to subscribe to. And the 'client' can subscribe to these items, and retrieve updates when they are updated.
